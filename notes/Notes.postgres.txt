All reference is to my repository nestjs-postgres-rest

first of all, i need to create a database using pgAdmin 
I can get the typeorm file from repository
Everything we need to do is connection to postgres, all crud operations are handled by typeorm 
    so we will do as same as in here we did for mongo , like this.create or this.findOne
in entity files , no _id will be automatically created by the way, as in here it gets created
