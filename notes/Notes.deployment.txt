Deployment is in the main nestjs course folder, i can do that from there 


add prestart:prod property in package.json as in here 
and do, yarn start:prod

transfer some of the devDependencies tp dependencies -- like these in this case as below bcz elasticbeanstalk only installs dependencies

    "@types/node": "^13.9.1",
    "@types/express": "^4.17.3",
    "ts-node": "9.0.0",
    "typescript": "^3.7.4"

add environment variables as process.env. variables as in typeorm file and auth MODULE file in jwt config 
and then i can see the video in nestjs course -> deployment -> video 8
and in the video,i have to do elasticbeanstalk create application, add env variables and deploy
in this case , i have 2 env variables, process.env.URL and process.env.JWT_SECRET
